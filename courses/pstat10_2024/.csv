"Slower and more examples, maybe run thru an example before we have to do it"
Explain code slowly and go over new material we haven’t covered
None
It’s already great right now
Maybe give an overview of all topic once a week
Try to be more engaging but other than that there is nothing else
Gives us more practice problem after class with correct answer for us to improve
The TA could check with the student more often
Maybe explain the thought process behind solving the problems
"Everything is fine, except for lecture pacing. Also increasing time spent on answer allows us to copy and look how it worked"
Working through each problem would be really helpful with more context on each topic would really help.
TA should keep in mind the fact that I wrote
Not much fairly good course
