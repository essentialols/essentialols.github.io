## Setting a seed

The following ensures you will get the same results as me.

```{r}
set.seed(10)
```

## Binomial distribution (slide 14)

Exactly equal to 4.
```{r}
dbinom(4, size = 10, prob = 0.18)
```

```{r}
sum(dbinom(0:4, size = 10, prob = 0.18))
```

Less than or equal to 4.

```{r}
pbinom(4, size = 10, prob = 0.18)
```


## Binomial distribution (slide 16)

Strictly less than 4.

```{r}
pbinom(3, size = 10, prob = 0.18)
```

Greater than or equal to 4.

```{r}
1 - pbinom(3, size = 10, prob = 0.18)
```

Equivalent with `lower.tail=F`

```{r}
pbinom(3, size = 10, prob = 0.18, lower.tail = F)
```
