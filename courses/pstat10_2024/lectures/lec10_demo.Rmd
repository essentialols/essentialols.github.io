## Setting a seed

The following ensures you will get the same results as me.

```{r}
set.seed(10)
```

## Uniform distribution (slide 15)

```{r}
punif(4.3, min = 0, max = 10) - punif(2.5, 0, 10) + punif(8, 0, 10, lower.tail = F)
```

## Normal distribution (slide 27)

```{r}
1 - pnorm(2, mean = 1, sd = 1.5)
```

Equivalently with `lower.tail=F`.

```{r}
pnorm(2, mean = 1, sd = 1.5, lower.tail = F)
```
