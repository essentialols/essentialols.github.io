Note: This practice midterm is supposed to be exemplary only. It shows
examples of the type of questions you can expect on the midterm exam.
The midterm exam will be longer: There will be enough questions for
the duration of the exam.
The questions on the midterm exam may include any of the content that has
been covered in the course so far. The questions on the midterm exam
may also differ from the practice exam in type, length, and difficulty. 

### MC Questions

**Question:**

Why should you use vectorized functions in R?

A. To handle large data sets efficiently  
B. To improve computation speed  
C. To simplify code readability  
D. To avoid explicit loops  
E. Both B and D  


**Question:**

Take a look at the R code below:

```r
numbers <- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
results <- sum(numbers * (numbers > 4))
print(results)
```

What is the output of this code?

A. 21  
B. 3  
C. 15  
D. 11  
E. An error message


### Fill-in-the-Blank Question

You are given the standard R dataset `mtcars`, which contains data on various car models, including their miles per gallon (mpg), number of cylinders (cyl), horsepower (hp), and other characteristics. Using the `dplyr` package from the `tidyverse`, write a pipeline to accomplish the following tasks:

1. Include only cars with more than 6 cylinders.
2. Retain only the columns `mpg`, `cyl`, `hp`, and `wt`.
3. Create a new column `power_to_weight` that is the ratio of horsepower to weight (hp/wt).

Complete the following code using the `dplyr` functions and the pipe (`%>%`).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

mtcars %>%
  ____1______(cyl > 6) %>%
  ____2______(mpg, cyl, hp, wt) %>%
  ____3______(power_to_weight = hp/wt)
```

**Fill in the blanks:**

1. __________
2. __________
3. __________


### Code Writing Prompt

Using the `mtcars` dataset in R, which includes metrics such as 
horsepower (hp) and weight (wt), write a script to calculate the 
horsepower to weight ratio for each car.

1. **Compute Efficiency Ratio:** Write a function named `efficiency_ratio` 
that takes horsepower and weight as parameters and returns their ratio.
2. **Apply the Function:** Use this function to compute the ratio for each car
in the `mtcars` dataset and add these values as a new column `hp_to_wt_ratio`.
3. **Output Results:** Display the `mtcars` dataset with the newly
computed `hp_to_wt_ratio` column.

Comments are optional.
