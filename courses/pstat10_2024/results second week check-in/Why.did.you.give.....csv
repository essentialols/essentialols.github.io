The professor explains everything good
More practice problems please! Want to maximize time spent practicing which is already solid
"The first week of lectures was a bit fast paced, but this week’s pace is good"

Professor is kind and patient when answering question
Professor is very nice
"I think your lecture is pretty good, very clear and also many practical questions help me improve my programming skill. Not only PSTAT 10 knowledge ,but also helpful for my future."
The lectures and sections are quite boring but super informative
Great but maybe expand the code for people who seat back could see more clearly
Maybe more practice for beginners will be better
Overall enjoyable and interactive
I think it can be improved by going at the same speed as section
I think the lectures are good and help me learn
Start of course it went by fast
Same as the one on the first page.
Nice professor
I believe they could be more detailed in steps but overall very good again
it’s very step by step and i like it. its a little fast
Solid lectures just would like to have explanations for why we use certain functions and how they work
